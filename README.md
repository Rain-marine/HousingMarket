# HousingMarket

Analysis of the **Villeurbanne (France)** housing market, 2017–2021  
by Rain-marine

---

## 📄 Overview

This project explores **housing prices, spatial patterns, and price determinants** in Villeurbanne from 2017 to 2021.  
It combines data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic modeling to identify the main factors that influence housing prices.

**Goals:**
- Understand price variations by district, area, and number of rooms  
- Examine how proximity to transport affects property values  
- Build baseline predictive models for price estimation  
- Visualize insights with clear, reproducible charts

## 📊 Main Visualizations

Typical visuals generated in the analysis include:

| Visualization                            | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📈 **Price Distribution Histogram**      | Shows how property prices are spread across the dataset |
| 🏘 **Price vs Surface Scatterplot**      | Illustrates how property size relates to total price    |
| 📦 **Boxplot: Price per m² by District** | Compares neighborhood-level price differences           |
| 🚉 **Map Overlay (Stations)**            | Displays housing data with public transport proximity   |

## 🧮 Analytical Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Remove duplicates, missing values, and extreme outliers
   * Standardize numeric columns and feature names
   * Merge datasets (`roomdummy.csv`, `station_coordinates.json`)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

   * Distribution plots for price and area
   * Correlation checks between variables
   * Grouping and summarizing by neighborhood or room count

3. **Modeling**

   * Baseline linear regression on `price` and `price_per_m2`
   * Log-transformed models for skewed variables
   * Feature importance interpretation

4. **Visualization**

   * Boxplots, scatterplots, maps, and regression diagnostics
   * All generated within `rain-phase2.Rmd`

## 🧾 Data Notes

Expected key columns:

| Column                 | Description                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `price`                | Total price of the property                           |
| `surface` or `area_m2` | Property size in square meters                        |
| `rooms`                | Number of rooms                                       |
| `district`             | Neighborhood identifier                               |
| `price_per_m2`         | Price divided by area (computed)                      |
| `lat`, `lon`           | Geographic coordinates                                |
| `station_distance`     | Distance to nearest metro/tram station (if available) |

If column names differ, adjust them in the R Markdown file before running.

## 🧠 Possible Extensions

* Add **spatial regression** (account for geographic clustering)
* Include **time trends** (price evolution from 2017–2021)
* Compare Villeurbanne vs Lyon or other nearby areas
* Deploy a **Shiny dashboard** for interactive price visualization
